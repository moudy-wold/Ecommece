Challenges and Solutions:
This was my first time working on backend development, which presented some technical challenges. However, I put in significant effort to ensure the system functions efficiently on a local environment.

Unable to publish live: Since I am unable to upload the backend due to my current level of experience, the project is currently running locally npm run dev.

Image Management:
For now, product images are added as links instead of files. However, I have prepared the frontend to handle file uploads if this feature is implemented later.

I have completed the task as per the requirements using the following technologies:

Frontend & Backend: Next.js (App Route)

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose)

State Management: Redux

Authentication: Next-auth

Payment: Stripe (for testing purposes)

Product Management:

Created an admin dashboard to add, edit, or delete products.

Designed a frontend interface to display products dynamically.

Note: Currently, due to my lack of backend experience, product images are added as links (not files), but the frontend is ready to handle file uploads if this feature is developed further.

Shopping Cart:

Implemented functionality for users to add products to the cart, update quantities, or remove items.

Used Redux to manage the cart state centrally.

Checkout Process:
Integrated a test payment process using Stripe. Users are redirected to a payment page to complete the transaction.

Note: While the payment flow could have been implemented directly on the frontend, I chose to redirect users to ensure a secure and seamless payment experience.
